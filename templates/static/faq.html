<h1>FAQs</h1><h2>What should I do with my refugee buddy?</h2><p>That's up to you and your buddy to work out. Chat, have a coffee, go to a sports match, art gallery, shopping or the beach. Find some similar interests and enjoy spending time together. Ask a few questions and be prepared to listen.  You will be supported by the organisation that contacts you and links you with your buddy.  The organisation will explain to you your rights and responsibilities as a volunteer and be able to help you with dealing with issues like confidentially, appropriate behaviour and finding further help.<h2>Is there any cost involved?</h2><p>You don't have to pay anything to become a refugee buddy.
